    """A mutable stabilizer circuit.

    The lestim.Circuit class is arguably the most important object in the
    entire library. It is the interface through which you explain a
    noisy quantum computation to Stim, in order to do fast bulk sampling
    or fast error analysis.

    For example, suppose you want to use a matching-based decoder on a
    new quantum error correction construction. Stim can help you do this
    but the very first step is to create a circuit implementing the
    construction. Once you have the circuit you can then use methods like
    lestim.Circuit.detector_error_model() to create an object that can be
    used to configure the decoder, or like
    lestim.Circuit.compile_detector_sampler() to produce problems for the
    decoder to solve, or like lestim.Circuit.shortest_graphlike_error() to
    check for mistakes in the implementation of the code.

    Examples:
        >>> import lestim
        >>> c = lestim.Circuit()
        >>> c.append("X", 0)
        >>> c.append("M", 0)

        This method ignores any noise in the circuit.

        This method works by performing a tableau stabilizer simulation of the circuit
        and, before each measurement is simulated, checking if its expectation is
        non-zero.

        A measurement is predictable if its result can be predicted by using other
        measurements that have already been performed, assuming the circuit is executed
        without any noise.

        Note that, when multiple measurements occur at the same time, re-ordering the
        order they are resolved can change which specific measurements are predictable
        but won't change how many of them were predictable in total.

        The number of predictable measurements is a useful quantity because it's
        related to the number of detectors and observables that a circuit should
        declare. If circuit.num_detectors + circuit.num_observables is less than
        circuit.count_determined_measurements(), this is a warning sign that you've
        missed some detector declarations.

        The exact relationship between the number of determined measurements and the
        number of detectors and observables can differ from code to code. For example,
        the toric code has an extra redundant measurement compared to the surface code
        because in the toric code the last X stabilizer to be measured is equal to the
        product of all other X stabilizers even in the first round when initializing in
        the Z basis. Typically this relationship is not declared as a detector, because
        it's not local, or as an observable, because it doesn't store a qubit.

        Returns:
            The number of measurements that were predictable.

        Args:
            decompose_errors: Defaults to false. When set to true, the error analysis
                attempts to decompose the components of composite error mechanisms (such
                as depolarization errors) into simpler errors, and suggest this
                decomposition via `lestim.target_separator()` between the components. For
                example, in an XZ surface code, single qubit depolarization has a Y
                error term which can be decomposed into simpler X and Z error terms.
                Decomposition fails (causing this method to throw) if it's not possible
                to decompose large errors into simple errors that affect at most two
                detectors.
            flatten_loops: Defaults to false. When set to True, the output will not
                contain any `repeat` blocks. When set to False, the error analysis
                watches for loops in the circuit reaching a periodic steady state with
                respect to the detectors being introduced, the error mechanisms that
                affect them, and the locations of the logical observables. When it
                identifies such a steady state, it outputs a repeat block. This is
                massively more efficient than flattening for circuits that contain
                loops, but creates a more complex output.
            allow_gauge_detectors: Defaults to false. When set to false, the error
                analysis verifies that detectors in the circuit are actually
                deterministic under noiseless execution of the circuit. When set to
                True, these detectors are instead considered to be part of degrees
                freedom that can be removed from the error model. For example, if
                detectors D1 and D3 both anti-commute with a reset, then the error model
                has a gauge `error(0.5) D1 D3`. When gauges are identified, one of the
                involved detectors is removed from the system using Gaussian
                elimination.

                Note that logical observables are still verified to be deterministic,
                even if this option is set.
            approximate_disjoint_errors: Defaults to false. When set to false, composite
                error mechanisms with disjoint components (such as
                `PAULI_CHANNEL_1(0.1, 0.2, 0.0)`) can cause the error analysis to throw
                exceptions (because detector error models can only contain independent
                error mechanisms). When set to true, the probabilities of the disjoint
                cases are instead assumed to be independent probabilities. For example,
                a `PAULI_CHANNEL_1(0.1, 0.2, 0.0)` becomes equivalent to an
                `X_ERROR(0.1)` followed by a `Y_ERROR(0.2)`. This assumption is an
                approximation, but it is a good approximation for small probabilities.

                This argument can also be set to a probability between 0 and 1, setting
                a threshold below which the approximation is acceptable. Any error
                mechanisms that have a component probability above the threshold will
                cause an exception to be thrown.
            ignore_decomposition_failures: Defaults to False.
                When this is set to True, circuit errors that fail to decompose into
                graphlike detector error model errors no longer cause the conversion
                process to abort. Instead, the undecomposed error is inserted into the
                output. Whatever tool the detector error model is then given to is
                responsible for dealing with the undecomposed errors (e.g. a tool may
                choose to simply ignore them).

                Irrelevant unless decompose_errors=True.
            block_decomposition_from_introducing_remnant_edges: Defaults to False.
                Requires that both A B and C D be present elsewhere in the detector
                error model in order to decompose A B C D into A B ^ C D. Normally, only
                one of A B or C D needs to appear to allow this decomposition.

                Remnant edges can be a useful feature for ensuring decomposition
                succeeds, but they can also reduce the effective code distance by giving
                the decoder single edges that actually represent multiple errors in the
                circuit (resulting in the decoder making misinformed choices when
                decoding).

                Irrelevant unless decompose_errors=True.

                    stabilizer circuits) initialized with the given circuit
                    as its default contents.

                very start of the circuit.

                Passing `range(A, B)` for a detector slice will show the
                slices for ticks A through B including A but excluding B.

        Returns:
            An object whose `__str__` method returns the diagram, so that
            writing the diagram to a file works correctly. The returned
            object may also define methods such as `_repr_html_`, so that
            ipython notebooks recognize it can be shown using a specialized
            viewer instead of as raw text.

        (see https://maxhs.org/docs/wdimacs.html). The optimal solution to the
        problem is the highest likelihood set of error mechanisms that combine to
        flip any logical observable while producing no detection events).

        If there are any errors with probability p > 0.5, they are inverted so
        that the resulting weight ends up being positive. If there are errors
        with weight close or equal to 0.5, they can end up with 0 weight meaning
        that they can be included or not in the solution with no affect on the
        likelihood.

        There are many tools that can solve maxSAT problems in WDIMACS format.
        One quick way to get started is to install pysat by running this BASH
        terminal command:

            pip install python-sat

        Afterwards, you can run the included maxSAT solver "RC2" with this

        THIS IS A HEURISTIC METHOD. It does not guarantee that it will find errors of
        particular sizes, or with particular properties. The errors it finds are a
        tangled combination of the truncation parameters you specify, internal
        optimizations which are correct when not truncating, and minutia of the circuit
        being considered.

        If you want a well behaved method that does provide guarantees of finding errors
        of a particular type, use `lestim.Circuit.shortest_graphlike_error`. This method
        is more thorough than that (assuming you don't truncate so hard you omit
        graphlike edges), but exactly how thorough is difficult to describe. It's also
        not guaranteed that the behavior of this method will not be changed in the
        future in a way that permutes which logical errors are found and which are
        missed.

        This search method considers hyper errors, so it has worst case exponential
        runtime. It is important to carefully consider the arguments you are providing,
        which truncate the search space and trade cost for quality.

        The search progresses by starting from each error that crosses a logical
        observable, noting which detection events each error produces, and then
        iteratively adding in errors touching those detection events attempting to
        cancel out the detection event with the lowest index.

        Beware that the choice of logical observable can interact with the truncation
        options. Using different observables can change whether or not the search
        succeeds, even if those observables are equal modulo the stabilizers of the
        code. This is because the edges crossing logical observables are used as
        starting points for the search, and starting from different places along a path
        will result in different numbers of symptoms in intermediate states as the
        search progresses. For example, if the logical observable is next to a boundary,
        then the starting edges are likely boundary edges (degree 1) with 'room to
        grow', whereas if the observable was running through the bulk then the starting
        edges will have degree at least 2.

                space by refusing to cross an edge (i.e. add an error) when doing so
                would produce an intermediate state that has more detection events than
                this limit.
            dont_explore_edges_with_degree_above: Truncates the search space by refusing
                to consider errors that cause a lot of detection events. For example,
                you may only want to consider graphlike errors which have two or fewer
                detection events.
            dont_explore_edges_increasing_symptom_degree: Truncates the search space by
                refusing to cross an edge (i.e. add an error) when doing so would
                produce an intermediate state that has more detection events that the
                previous intermediate state. This massively improves the efficiency of
                the search because instead of, for example, exploring all n^4 possible
                detection event sets with 4 symptoms, the search will attempt to cancel
                out symptoms one by one.

        A "graphlike error" is an error that creates at most two detection events

            A list of error mechanisms that cause an undetected logical error.

            Each entry in the list is a `lestim.ExplainedError` detailing the location
            and effects of a single physical error. The effects of the entire list
            combine to produce a logical frame change without any detection events.

    def time_reversed_for_flows(
        self,
        flows: Iterable[lestim.Flow],

        dont_turn_measurements_into_resets: bool = False,

        """Time-reverses the circuit while preserving error correction structure.

        This method returns a circuit that has the same internal detecting regions
        as the given circuit, as well as the same internal-to-external flows given
        in the `flows` argument, except they are all time-reversed. For example, if
        you pass a fault tolerant preparation circuit into this method (1 -> Z), the
        result will be a fault tolerant *measurement* circuit (Z -> 1). Or, if you
        pass a fault tolerant C_XYZ circuit into this method (X->Y, Y->Z, and Z->X),
        the result will be a fault tolerant C_ZYX circuit (X->Z, Y->X, and Z->Y).

        Note that this method doesn't guarantee that it will preserve the *sign* of the
        detecting regions or stabilizer flows. For example, inverting a memory circuit
        that preserves a logical observable (X->X and Z->Z) may produce a
        memory circuit that always bit flips the logical observable (X->X and Z->-Z) or
        that dynamically adjusts the logical observable in response to measurements
        (like "X -> X xor rec[-1]" and "Z -> Z xor rec[-2]").

        This method will turn time-reversed resets into measurements, and attempts to
        turn time-reversed measurements into resets. A measurement will time-reverse
        into a reset if some annotated detectors, annotated observables, or given flows
        have detecting regions with sensitivity just before the measurement but none
        have detecting regions with sensitivity after the measurement.

        In some cases this method will have to introduce new operations. In particular,
        when a measurement-reset operation has a noisy result, time-reversing this
        measurement noise produces reset noise. But the measure-reset operations don't
        have built-in reset noise, so the reset noise is specified by adding an X_ERROR
        or Z_ERROR noise instruction after the time-reversed measure-reset operation.

        Args:
            flows: Flows you care about, that reach past the start/end of the given
                circuit. The result will contain an inverted flow for each of these
                given flows. You need this information because it reveals the
                measurements needed to produce the inverted flows that you care
                about.

                An exception will be raised if the circuit doesn't have all these
                flows. The inverted circuit will have the inverses of these flows
                (ignoring sign).
            dont_turn_measurements_into_resets: Defaults to False. When set to
                True, measurements will time-reverse into measurements even if
                nothing is sensitive to the measured qubit after the measurement
                completes. This guarantees the output circuit has *all* flows
                that the input circuit has (up to sign and feedback), even ones
                that aren't annotated.

        Returns:
            An (inverted_circuit, inverted_flows) tuple.

            inverted_circuit is the qec inverse of the given circuit.

            inverted_flows is a list of flows, matching up by index with the flows
            given as arguments to the method. The input, output, and sign fields
            of these flows are boring. The useful field is measurement_indices,
            because it's difficult to predict which measurements are needed for
            the inverted flow due to effects such as implicitly-included resets
            inverting into explicitly-included measurements.

        Caveats:
            Currently, this method doesn't compute the sign of the inverted flows.
            It unconditionally sets the sign to False.

        """Returns a circuit without feedback with rewritten detectors/observables.

        When a feedback operation affects the expected parity of a detector or
        observable, the measurement controlling that feedback operation is implicitly
        part of the measurement set that defines the detector or observable. This
        method removes all feedback, but avoids changing the meaning of detectors or
        observables by turning these implicit measurement dependencies into explicit
        measurement dependencies added to the observable or detector.

        This method guarantees that the detector error model derived from the original
        circuit, and the transformed circuit, will be equivalent (modulo floating point
        rounding errors and variations in where loops are placed). Specifically, the
        following should be true for any circuit:

            dem1 = circuit.flattened().detector_error_model()
            dem2 = circuit.with_inlined_feedback().flattened().detector_error_model()
            assert dem1.approx_equals(dem2, 1e-5)

        Returns:
            A `lestim.Circuit` with feedback operations removed, with rewritten DETECTOR
            instructions (as needed to avoid changing the meaning of each detector), and
            with additional OBSERVABLE_INCLUDE instructions (as needed to avoid changing
            the meaning of each observable).

            The circuit's function is permitted to differ from the original in that
            any feedback operation can be pushed to the end of the circuit and
            discarded. All non-feedback operations must stay where they are, preserving
            the structure of the circuit.

                When set to an integer, making the exact same series calls on the exact

                CAUTION: simulation results *MAY NOT* be consistent if you vary how many
                shots are taken. For example, taking 10 shots and then 90 shots will

        """Creates a measurement sampler for the given circuit.

        The sampler uses a noiseless reference sample, collected from the circuit using
        stim's Tableau simulator during initialization of the sampler, as a baseline for
        deriving more samples using an error propagation simulator.

        Args:
            circuit: The stim circuit to sample from.
            skip_reference_sample: Defaults to False. When set to True, the reference
                sample used by the sampler is initialized to all-zeroes instead of being
                collected from the circuit. This means that the results returned by the
                sampler are actually whether or not each measurement was *flipped*,
                instead of true measurement results.

                Forcing an all-zero reference sample is useful when you are only
                interested in error propagation and don't want to have to deal with the
                fact that some measurements want to be On when no errors occur. It is
                also useful when you know for sure that the all-zero result is actually
                a possible result from the circuit (under noiseless execution), meaning
                it is a valid reference sample as good as any other. Computing the
                reference sample is the most time consuming and memory intensive part of
                simulating the circuit, so promising that the simulator can safely skip
                that step is an effective optimization.
            seed: PARTIALLY determines simulation results by deterministically seeding
                the random number generator.

                Must be None or an integer in range(2**64).

                Defaults to None. When None, the prng is seeded from system entropy.

                When set to an integer, making the exact same series calls on the exact
                same machine with the exact same version of Stim will produce the exact
                same simulation results.

                CAUTION: simulation results *WILL NOT* be consistent between versions of
                lestim. This restriction is present to make it possible to have future
                optimizations to the random sampling, and is enforced by introducing
                intentional differences in the seeding strategy from version to version.

                CAUTION: simulation results *MAY NOT* be consistent across machines that
                differ in the width of supported SIMD instructions. For example, using
                the same seed on a machine that supports AVX instructions and one that
                only supports SSE instructions may produce different simulation results.

                CAUTION: simulation results *MAY NOT* be consistent if you vary how many
                shots are taken. For example, taking 10 shots and then 90 shots will
                give different results from taking 100 shots in one call.
            reference_sample: The data to xor into the measurement flips produced by the
                frame simulator, in order to produce proper measurement results.
                This can either be specified as an `np.bool_` array or a bit packed
                `np.uint8` array (little endian). Under normal conditions, the reference
                sample should be a valid noiseless sample of the circuit, such as the
                one returned by `circuit.reference_sample()`. If this argument is not
                provided, the reference sample will be set to
                `circuit.reference_sample()`, unless `skip_reference_sample=True`

class DetectorErrorModel:
    """An error model built out of independent error mechanics.

    This class is one of the most important classes in Stim, because it is the
    mechanism used to explain circuits to decoders. A typical workflow would
    look something like:

        1. Create a quantum error correction circuit annotated with detectors
            and observables.
        2. Fail at configuring your favorite decoder using the circuit, because
            it's a pain to convert circuit error mechanisms into a format
            understood by the decoder.
        2a. Call circuit.detector_error_model(), with decompose_errors=True
            if working with a matching-based code. This converts the circuit
            errors into a straightforward list of independent "with
            probability p these detectors and observables get flipped" terms.
        3. Write tedious but straightforward glue code to create whatever
            graph-like object the decoder needs from the detector error model.
        3a. Actually, ideally, someone has already done that for you. For
            example, pymatching can take detector error models directly and
            sinter knows how to explain a detector error model to fusion_blossom.
        4. Get samples using circuit.compile_detector_sampler(), feed them to
            the decoder, and compare its observable flip predictions to the
            actual flips recorded in the samples.
        4a. Actually, sinter will basically handle steps 2 through 4 for you.
            So you should probably have just generated your circuits, called
            `sinter collect` on them, then `sinter plot` on the results.
        5. Write the paper.

    Error mechanisms are described in terms of the visible detection events and the
    hidden observable frame changes that they causes. Error mechanisms can also
    suggest decompositions of their effects into components, which can be helpful
    for decoders that want to work with a simpler decomposed error model instead of
    the full error model.

                shots are taken. For example, taking 10 shots and then 90 shots will

        minimum *number* of physical errors, not the maximum probability of those
        physical errors all occurring.

        This method works by looking for errors that have frame changes (eg.
        "error(0.1) D0 D1 L5" flips the frame of observable 5). These errors are
        converted into one or two symptoms and a net frame change. The symptoms can then
        be moved around by following errors touching that symptom. Each symptom is moved
        until it disappears into a boundary or cancels against another remaining
        symptom, while leaving the other symptoms alone (ensuring only one symptom is
        allowed to move significantly reduces waste in the search space). Eventually a
        path or cycle of errors is found that cancels out the symptoms, and if there is
        still a frame change at that point then that path or cycle is a logical error
        (otherwise all that was found was a stabilizer of the system; a dead end). The
        search process advances like a breadth first search, seeded from all the
        frame-change errors and branching them outward in tandem, until one of them wins
        the race to find a solution.

        Args:
            ignore_ungraphlike_errors: Defaults to False. When False, an exception is
                raised if there are any errors in the model that are not graphlike. When
                True, those errors are skipped as if they weren't present.

                A graphlike error is an error with less than two symptoms. For the
                purposes of this method, errors are also considered graphlike if they
                are decomposed into graphlike components:

                graphlike:
                    error(0.1) D0
                    error(0.1) D0 D1
                    error(0.1) D0 D1 L0
                not graphlike but decomposed into graphlike components:
                    error(0.1) D0 D1 ^ D2
                not graphlike, not decomposed into graphlike components:
                    error(0.1) D0 D1 D2
                    error(0.1) D0 D1 D2 ^ D3

        Returns:
            A detector error model containing just the error instructions corresponding
            to an undetectable logical error. There will be no other kinds of
            instructions (no `repeat`s, no `shift_detectors`, etc). The error
            probabilities will all be set to 1.

            The `len` of the returned model is the graphlike code distance of the
            circuit. But beware that in general the true code distance may be smaller.
            For example, in the XZ surface code with twists, the true minimum sized
            logical error is likely to use Y errors. But each Y error decomposes into
            two graphlike components (the X part and the Z part). As a result, the
            graphlike code distance in that context is likely to be nearly twice as
            large as the true code distance.

                randomization used). Set to True to disable stabilizer randomization.

                Stabilizer randomization means that, when a qubit is initialized or
                measured in the Z basis, a Z error is added to the qubit with 50%
                probability. More generally, anytime a stabilizer is introduced into
                the system by any means, an error equal to that stabilizer is applied
                with 50% probability. This ensures that observables anticommuting with
                stabilizers of the system must be maximally uncertain. In other words,
                this feature enforces Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.

                This is a safety feature that you should not turn off unless you have a
                reason to do so. Stabilizer randomization is turned on by default
                because it catches mistakes. For example, suppose you are trying to
                create a stabilizer code but you accidentally have the code measure two
                anticommuting stabilizers. With stabilizer randomization turned off, it
                will look like this code works. With stabilizer randomization turned on,
                the two measurements will correctly randomize each other revealing that
                the code doesn't work.

                In some use cases, stabilizer randomization is a hindrance instead of
                helpful. For example, if you are using the flip simulator to understand
                how an error propagates through the system, the stabilizer randomization
                will be introducing error terms that you don't want.

            num_qubits: Sets the initial number of qubits tracked by the simulation.
                The simulator will still automatically resize as needed when qubits
                beyond this limit are touched.

                This parameter exists as a way to hint at the desired size of the
                simulator's state for performance, and to ensure methods that
                peek at the size have the expected size from the start instead of
                only after the relevant qubits have been touched.

            seed: PARTIALLY determines simulation results by deterministically seeding
                the random number generator.

                Must be None or an integer in range(2**64).

                Defaults to None. When None, the prng is seeded from system entropy.

                When set to an integer, making the exact same series calls on the exact
                same machine with the exact same version of Stim will produce the exact
                same simulation results.

                CAUTION: simulation results *WILL NOT* be consistent between versions of
                lestim. This restriction is present to make it possible to have future
                optimizations to the random sampling, and is enforced by introducing
                intentional differences in the seeding strategy from version to version.

                CAUTION: simulation results *MAY NOT* be consistent across machines that
                differ in the width of supported SIMD instructions. For example, using
                the same seed on a machine that supports AVX instructions and one that
                only supports SSE instructions may produce different simulation results.

                CAUTION: simulation results *MAY NOT* be consistent if you vary how the
                circuit is executed. For example, reordering whether a reset on one
                qubit happens before or after a reset on another qubit can result in
                different measurement results being observed starting from the same
                seed.

class Flow:
    """A stabilizer flow (e.g. "XI -> XX xor rec[-1]").

    Stabilizer circuits implement, and can be defined by, how they turn input
    stabilizers into output stabilizers mediated by measurements. These
    relationships are called stabilizer flows, and `lestim.Flow` is a representation
    of such a flow. For example, a `lestim.Flow` can be given to
    `lestim.Circuit.has_flow` to verify that a circuit implements the flow.

    A circuit has a stabilizer flow P -> Q if it maps the instantaneous stabilizer
    P at the start of the circuit to the instantaneous stabilizer Q at the end of
    the circuit. The flow may be mediated by certain measurements. For example,
    a lattice surgery CNOT involves an MXX measurement and an MZZ measurement, and
    the CNOT flows implemented by the circuit involve these measurements.

    A flow like P -> Q means the circuit transforms P into Q.
    A flow like 1 -> P means the circuit prepares P.
    A flow like P -> 1 means the circuit measures P.
    A flow like 1 -> 1 means the circuit contains a check (could be a DETECTOR).

    References:
        Stim's gate documentation includes the stabilizer flows of each gate.

        Appendix A of https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02192 describes how flows are
        defined and provides a circuit construction for experimentally verifying
        their presence.

                        1. An MPP layer measuring each of the tableau's stabilizers.
                        2. A feedback layer using the measurement results to control
                            whether or not to apply each of the tableau's destabilizers
                            in order to get the correct sign for each stabilizer.

                    Note: "mpp_state" treats the tableau as a state instead of as a
                    Clifford operation. It will preserve the set of stabilizers, but
                    not the exact choice of generators.
                "mpp_state_unsigned": Prepares the tableau's state up to sign using MPP.
                    Gate set: MPP
                    Circuit qubit count: n
                    Circuit operation count: O(n^2)

                    The circuit will contain a series of MPP measurements measuring each
                    of the tableau's stabilizers. The stabilizers are measured in the
                    order used by the tableau (i.e. tableau.z_output(k) is the k'th
                    stabilizer measured).

                    Note: "mpp_state_unsigned" treats the tableau as a state instead of
                    as a Clifford operation. It will preserve the set of stabilizers,
                    but not the exact choice of generators.

        The stabilizer generators of the tableau are its Z outputs. Canonicalizing
        standardizes the generators, so that states that are equal will produce the

        states and all canonicalize to [ZI, IZ].

        The canonical form is computed as follows:

            1. Get a list of stabilizers using `tableau.z_output(k)` for each k.
            2. Perform Gaussian elimination. pivoting on standard generators.

                    go to the next g.
                2c) Multiply that stabilizer into all other stabilizers that use the

            canonicalize: Defaults to False. When False, the tableau's Z outputs
                are returned unchanged. When True, the Z outputs are rewritten

                and copy_rng are set, an exception is raised. Defaults to False.

                the random number generator.

                Must be None or an integer in range(2**64).

                Defaults to None. When None, the prng state is either copied from the
                original simulator or reseeded from system entropy, depending on the
                copy_rng argument.

                When set to an integer, making the exact same series calls on the exact
                same machine with the exact same version of Stim will produce the exact
                same simulation results.

                CAUTION: simulation results *WILL NOT* be consistent between versions of
                lestim. This restriction is present to make it possible to have future
                optimizations to the random sampling, and is enforced by introducing
                intentional differences in the seeding strategy from version to version.

                CAUTION: simulation results *MAY NOT* be consistent across machines that
                differ in the width of supported SIMD instructions. For example, using
                the same seed on a machine that supports AVX instructions and one that
                only supports SSE instructions may produce different simulation results.

                CAUTION: simulation results *MAY NOT* be consistent if you vary how the
                circuit is executed. For example, reordering whether a reset on one
                qubit happens before or after a reset on another qubit can result in
                different measurement results being observed starting from the same

            See https://github.com/quantumlib/Stim/blob/main/doc/result_formats.md
        num_measurements: How many measurements there are per shot.
        num_detectors: How many detectors there are per shot.
        num_observables: How many observables there are per shot.
            Note that this only refers to observables *in the given shot data*, not
            to observables from the original circuit that was sampled.

    Examples:
        >>> import lestim
        >>> import pathlib
        >>> import tempfile
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as d:
        ...     path = pathlib.Path(d) / 'shots'
        ...     shot_data = np.array([
        ...         [0, 1, 0],
        ...         [0, 1, 1],
        ...     ], dtype=np.bool_)
        ...
        ...     lestim.write_shot_data_file(
        ...         path=str(path),
        ...         data=shot_data,
        ...         format='01',
        ...         num_measurements=3)
        ...
        ...     with open(path) as f:
        ...         written = f.read()
        >>> written
        '010\n011\n'
